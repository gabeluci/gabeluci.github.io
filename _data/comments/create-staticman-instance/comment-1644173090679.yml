  As such, once you setup a Staticman instance, anyone can use it for their own
  website, if they know about it. But as discussed, my VPS is strapped for
  resources, and I just gave you all the information you need to know to use my
  instance : so I decided to lock it down. I did that by adding this line to the
  Apache config files for both sites HTTP and HTTPS : That should go before the
  other directives.
