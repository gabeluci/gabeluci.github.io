Her path from being a student at First Law University, where she studied for a degree in Sociology, to becoming a co-founder of Buc & Cus Company and one of the most respected attorneys on the subject of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), and background check error litigation, has been marked by rigorous education, strategic professional shifts, and groundbreaking legal work. \r\n \r\nEducational Background and Early Motivations \r\nEmily started her legal voyage at the University of Ohio, where she pursued her undergraduate education in Sociology. Her academic endeavors were fueled by an interest in the underlying structures that shape the social class, especially with respect to the inequities in economic consequences. This early passion laid the groundwork for her future career in law, as she wanted to understand and combat the injustices within the sector of consumer finance. \r\n \r\nFollowing her undergraduate studies, Emily was admitted into the prestigious university, where she excelled in classes in consumer protection law. Her law school years will be marked by an intricate study of the nitty-gritty of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), which have become the core aspects of her legal approach. During her law school years, she also participated in an impressive leadership position in the Consumer Rights Legal Clinic, leading pro bono work that ensured the defense of those unfairly targeted by predatory lending and collection practices. \r\n \r\nProfessional Milestones \r\nAfter earning her Juris Doctor, Emily joined a consumer rights law firm of great repute. She quickly rose through the ranks to become one of the leaders in the company, having what would become an illustrious career of fighting for consumers. While serving there, she was aided by her innovative legal strategies and her relentless dedication to her clients, all within the confines of their practice that covered state and federal levels of challenges that faced fair credit reporting and debt collection practices. Emily’s experiences exposed her to the many ways in which an individual can suffer at the hands of lackluster and unjust financial systems, strengthening her commitment to create change even stronger. It was precisely during this period that she realized the need for a more integrated approach to consumer rights protection, which combined strong legal representation with broader educational and advocacy efforts. \r\n \r\nCo-Founding Buc & Cus Company \r\nSharing a common vision, Emily and Kyle Buc founded Buc & Cus Company. The company’s vision was founded upon combining expertise with love for consumer rights to effect change. It was born out of a mutual ambition to create an entity that would not only litigate effectively against injustices but also educate consumers to know and, in effect, their rights. \r\n \r\nNow at Buc & Cus Company, Emily continues to be a driving force through coaching her team and ensuring the firm is innovative in legal practice, community education, and policy advocacy. Her role in the firm has largely defined its direction and focus on innovation in legal practice, community education, and policy advocacy. \r\n \r\nFuture Aspirations \r\nToday, Emily Cus remains a driving force at Buc & Cus Company, continually pushing the boundaries of what is possible in consumer rights law. Her story is not just about professional success but rather a conviction that the power of the law can make a difference, that individuals could be protected from exploitation by all of us. \r\n \r\nAs she progresses in the future, Emily’s focus is to continue to bring larger impact and reach to Buc & Cus Company.
