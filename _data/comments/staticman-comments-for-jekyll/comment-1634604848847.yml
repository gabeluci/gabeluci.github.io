message: "All the changes I made are in this branch of the fork I made: https://github.com/gabeluci/staticman/tree/accepted-notifications \r\n\r\nI think it's a little behind the main Staticman repository now, but that's the code I'm using.\r\n\r\nDid you create your own Mailgun account and put your API key in the Staticman config?"
