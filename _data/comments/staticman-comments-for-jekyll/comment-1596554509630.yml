message: "There is already my fork that has all the changes: https://github.com/gabeluci/staticman/tree/accepted-notifications\r\nBut forking it doesn't mean it's hosted anywhere. Many people have deployed to Heroku. There's a button in the [Introduction](https://github.com/gabeluci/staticman/tree/accepted-notifications#introduction) section of the README that can start that process for you. I don't use Heroku, so I can't help any further with that. But search online and you'll find articles about it."
