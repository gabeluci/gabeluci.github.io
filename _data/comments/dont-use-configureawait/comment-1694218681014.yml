  I needed the VS2019 DTE2 for IDE events. I used
  package.GetServiceAsync(GetType(DTE)).ConfigureAwait(false))... the Default.
  When I did a breakpoint on that line then stepped through, my DTE events all
  worked. W/o the breakpoint it failed. I changed ConfigureAwait(false) to True.
  All worked fine. This may be an "obvious" to the experts. It was not for me.
