  If your 3 class libraries will only ever be used in your web application, then
  you don't need to use `ConfigureAwait(false)`. But if you intend for those
  libraries to be used in any application in the future, then you should use
  `ConfigureAwait(false)` on every `await` in those libraries. In the web
  project, there's no reason to use it.
