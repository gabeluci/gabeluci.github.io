  I have only a vague idea of what a synchronization context is or when I'd need
  to control it. (Actually I'd say I have a pretty good idea of what they are,
  but a hazy idea of how the C# implementation and library support works.) But
  say I have a WinForms UI element (e.g. Button) event handler that contains
  awaited calls to a lower level method. I obviously want those awaits to
  continue on the UI thread, so no ConfigureAwait call there. *But* if the lower
  level methods that are awaited also contain await calls their continuations
  will sometimes lock up the UI thread. I don't really understand why, but if I
  add a ConfigureAwait(false) to the lower level await, it usually prevents the
  locking up.
