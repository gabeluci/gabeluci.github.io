message: "Almost that, in my case it's more {DomainB\\User} is a member of {DomainA\\Group3}, and {DomainA\\Group3} is a member of {DomainA\\Group2}, which is a member of {DomainA\\Group1}. And I'm trying to check if {DomainB\\User} is a member of {DomainA\\Group1} (but with recursive, one more level should not make a difference).\r\n\r\nHere the info I have:\r\n\r\n1. {DomainA\\Group1} groupScope is Local. It's member {DomainA\\Group2} groupScope is Universal. And {DomainA\\Group3} (which is a member of Group2) groupScope is Global (and my DomainB\\User is a member of Group3).\r\n2. I didn't see the \"Group Type\" exactly but Group1, Group2 and Group3 have a flag {IsSecurityGroup} and it's true for the 3 groups so I would say yes.\r\n3. Group1 is in DomainA (same as all the other group, only my user is in another Domain. I tested with a user in the same Domain as all the group and everything works perfectly in that case).\r\n4. Yes I have the recursive parameter set to true. (no choice, the security group only contains group, the user are always at least 1 or 2 layers under the main security group I'm looking for permission)\r\n\r\nI also know that when testing, I've seen the groupSid of Group2 and Group3 in the {tokenGroupsGlobalAndUniversal} of DomainB\\User and they are correctly listed in {fspFilters} and added to the filter for {DirectorySearcher}. \r\n\r\nIt's strange that the searcher can't find something when the search root is {DomainA\\Group1} and that {DomainA\\Group2} his a member (and his groupSid is listed in the filter) but it still find nothing.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help."
