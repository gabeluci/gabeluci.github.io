  While testing my new code, I discovered something I wasn't expecting - Domain
  Users is not a domain local group. It has the Global Group bit set, and the
  Security group bit set (0x80000002). So it looks like that group type should
  also be considered as a possible group that can have FSP's as members. I think
  maybe if it has 0x2 set or 0x4 set - does that sound right to you?
