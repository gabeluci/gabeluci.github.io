message: "That `if` statement is saying \"if it's *not* a universal group\". Then it checks if the user and group are on different domains. A global group could pass the \"not universal\" test, but global groups can't have members from other domains. So if we get into the second `if`, then we know it's domain local. But you are right that the `if` could be simplified to just check if it's a domain local group right away rather than \"not a universal group\". I'll update that to be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (((int) group.Properties[\"groupType\"].Value & 4) == 4)\r\n```"
