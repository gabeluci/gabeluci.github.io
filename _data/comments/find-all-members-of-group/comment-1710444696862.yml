message: "My sample code above shows how to do the paging. First is asks for the members:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngroup.RefreshCache(new[] { \"member\" });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen it enters a loop that eventually asks for the next batch, using this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ngroup.RefreshCache(new[] {$\"member;range={membersFound}-*\"});\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the first iteration of the loop, that will be `\"member;range=1500-*\"`, meaning, \"give me the members skipping the first 1500\". It continues in that loop until an error is thrown that indicates there are no more members."
