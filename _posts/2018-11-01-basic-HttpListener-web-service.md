Sometimes you need to run tasks in the background, which is a job well-suited for Windows services;
they're designed to stay running all the time. However, you will often want some kind of front-end
to monitor what the service is doing. If your Windows service writes to a database, then you can use that:
your front-end can just read from the database. But if not, you will want your front end to be able to
communicate with your service directly.

You could build some kind of custom way of communicating, but web services are well-known and easy to work
with from any front-end application. The .NET Framework does provide a class to create your own web server:
[`HttpListener`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/network-programming/httplistener).
It's handy, but you do have to **construct every HTTP response from scratch**, which is different than writing
something in ASP.NET, for example.

In this example, I'll show you how to use that to create a simple web service in any application (like a Windows service) so other applications can communicated with it.

## Caveat

Note that this example **does not provide any authentication mechanism**. It listens on `localhost`, so
if your front-end is running on the same server, then this should work just fine as long as the port 
you use for this is not exposed to the internet. Otherwise, you will have to implement some kind of authentication.
It should be easy enough to inspect the HTTP header for an API key, for example.

## What does it do?

In this example, the service will either return its current settings via `GET http://localhost:8888/settings`,
or accept new settings via `PUT http://localhost:8888/settings`. Otherwise it will return an `HTTP 404` response.

## How to use

To use this, call `WebService.StartWebServer()` when your application starts, and `WebService.StopWebServer()` to shut it down gracefully.
The `StopWebServer()` method is written so that, if it happens to be currently processing a request, it will wait until it is done
rather than kill it.
